# COVERAGE.MK --Rules for building coverage reports with gcov, lcov.

# trace.info:          --Collate the coverage data for this tree of files.
# coverage/index.html: --Create the html-formatted coverage reports.
# clean:               --Remove the coverage data and reports.
# +version:            --Report details of tools used by coverage
#
# Remarks:
# The coverage module provides the phony targets "coverage" "html-coverage".
# These targets build textual and html coverage reports respectively.
#
# Coverage is tied fairly closely to gcov/lcov, and therefore the GCC
# toolchain; you must add "--coverage" to $(CFLAGS) for the statistics
# files to be generated, and to $(LDFLAGS) to link in the
# statistics-gathering code.
#
# The "coverage" target is auto-recursive, and is used to
# generate the text reports per directory.  The HTML reports
# act on an entire tree, so they are not generated recursively; you must
# move to a directory and "make html-coverage".
#
# The coverage target generates coverage data for the files specified
# by $(GCOV_FILES), which is automatically defined via $(C_SRC) and
# $(C++_SRC).
#
# Note: this file uses an ifdef guard to prevent it being included twice.
