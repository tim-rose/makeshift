# LIBRARY.MK: rules to build and install a library composed of a set of objects.
#
# Contents:
# pre-build:           --Stage the include files.
# install-lib:         --Install all the library components
# install-lib-lib:     --Install the library ".a", ".so" files only.
# install-lib-include: --Install the library include files only.
# install-lib-man:     --Install manual pages for the library only.
# clean:               --Remove the include files installed at $LIB_ROOT/include.
# distclean:           --Remove the include files installed at $LIB_ROOT/include.
#
# Remarks:
# The "library" module provides rules for managing a collection of
# object files (i.e. ".o" files) as an object library (i.e. ".a", ".so").
# The library can be structured as a collection of "sub" libraries
# built from code in sub-directories.  The top-level directory
# delegates building of the sub-libraries to recursive make targets,
# and then assembles them all into one master library.
#
# These rules are controlled by the following macros:
#
#  * LIB_ROOT --the root location of the main top-level library (default: ".")
#  * LIB_NAME --the name of the library to build (default: name of current dir)
#  * LIB_TYPE --either or both "static" "shared" (default: "static")
#
# The list of objects to add to the library are defined as the dependants
# of the library target, and these are added to by language-specific
# definitions. See c-library.mk for example.
